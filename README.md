Our website is somewhat mobile friendly. To generate a password on your mobile device follow these steps: 

* From the drop down choose "Walk a path and manually record coordinates (without a timer)"
* Click the start button. 
* Click record location to log a latitude and longitude coordinate (this may take a couple seconds). 
* Once you have recoreded each point of your path click stop. 
* If you wish to set your password hit "Set password", otherwise hit "Enter password" to populate the password input field.
* If you chose "Set password" repeate steps 1-5. On step 5 hit "Enter password".
